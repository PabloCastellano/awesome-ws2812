# Awesome ws2812

A curated list of awesome resources for ws281x LED strips and matrices.

Most of them are meant to be controlled using ESP8266 chips programmed with Arduino.

**If you have an awesome project that is not listed here yet, your Pull Request is very welcome!**

## What is ws2812

The ws2812 is an intelligent control LED light source, with the control circuit and RGB chip integrated directly into a 5050 RGB LED.

Some features:

* The control circuit and the LED share the only power source.
* Built-in electric reset circuit and power lost reset circuit.
* Each pixel of the three primary color can achieve 256 brightness display, completed 16777216 color full color display, and scan frequency not less than 400Hz/s.
* Cascading port transmission signal by single line.
